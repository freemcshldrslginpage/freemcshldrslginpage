While it is sadly the case that a certain seedy underbelly does exist in the industry, a 2010 report found that some short-term borrowers can find using payday loans a positive experience, provided the loan is paid off in the short term. The same report concluded that: "there is currently no clear evidence that banning payday loans necessarily helps consumers avoid financial difficulties. Indeed, the loans can have advantages over some other forms of credit. For example, they can be cheaper than unauthorised overdrafts (which are outside the consumer's control in terms of whether or not they are granted). It is also possible that, if they were to be removed from the market place, illegal lending could prosper" (Keeping the plates spinning - Perceptions of payday loans in Great Britain, Marie Burton, 2010).

It's a fact that individuals who cannot manage their finances responsibly use the short term credit services, knowing full well that they will not be able to repay the loan come payday. However, short term credit is a useful tool to those who find themselves in an emergency situation, or even those without access to mainstream credit options. The bottom line is this: payday loans are meant to be a temporary solution. It's true that the interest rates are high, and can even look exorbitant when viewed in light of annual fees. When fees are viewed in a one to three week timeframe, though, the rates become much more reasonable.
